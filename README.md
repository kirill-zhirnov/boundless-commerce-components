# Boundless Commerce Components

Components for E-commerce store: List of products, Individual product page, Thumbnail views, Cart helpers.

The components can be used with React or Next.js.

The library has 2 entry points: 

- General - `import {Products, Product} from 'boundless-commerce-components'`
- Client - `import {BoundlessCart} from 'boundless-commerce-components/dist/client'`

The client entry point uses client's hooks (`useEffect` and so on) and in Next.JS v14 should be used with `use client`
directive. [Read more about Client components in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)
